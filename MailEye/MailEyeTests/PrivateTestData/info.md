This file can contain private data (not to be submitted to a public repository)

Copy over some test files and set the git flag "skip worktree"

For example, when in this directory:

`git update-index --skip-worktree *`

This won't submit data to git for all files in the PrivateTestData folder

All the empty mbox files can then be replaced with actual mbo
