// If no streams are found, even if everything seems correct, one may need to place a file
// called lsl_api.cfg in the ~/lsl_api/ folder.
// The contents of the lsl_api.cfg can be something like this:
// 
// [lab]
// KnownPeers = {10.211.55.5}
//
// Where KnownPeers contains the IP addresses of the machines pushing LSL samples.
//
// The lsl_api.cfg must contain the IP(s) of the streams we are trying to connect to.
